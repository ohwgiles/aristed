aristed is a C++ editor that aims to provide semantic highlighting, completion and diagnostics of the quality present in Eclipse (but without Java) and XCode (but cross-platform), with all the accessibility of a lightweight, Notepad++-style user interface.

aristed is currently in VERY early stages of development. Jump in and have a hack while the code base is still small and understandable!

(Planned) Features
- High degree of semanticity thanks to Clang
- Fast, unobtrusive UI based on Qt
- Optionally completely keyboard-driven

Core philosophy: Write as little code as possible, rely on libraries
